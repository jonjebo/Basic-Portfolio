    <p>Good morning, afternoon, or night to you! My name is Jonathan Dangelo and I am currently writing my first "About Me" page.<br>
        I currently live in sunny SoCal, but am originally from a small farming town in Ohio where I was born and raised. Once I graduated<br>
        high school I moved to Colorado where I spent a few years in Vail snowboarding and enjoying life! When I was there I had some of <br>
        best experiences of my life and made some of the best friends I've ever had. Vail is a place that gets visitors from all over the <br>
        world and every year I made new friends from other countries. I do not regret one day that I spent there.</p>
    <p>Then my world changed and I decided that I wanted to gain my Bachelors from CSU in Fort Collins, Colorado. I then spent the next <br>
        five years there going to school and getting used to the change of pace from Vail. I made many more friends and had many nights <br>
        nights out with friends over beers. The 5 years in Fort Collins were some of the best I've had as well because I loved the town <br>
        town and the people I was surrounded by. Colorado has become much more fast paced since I have left a couple years ago. Around <br>
        the time I moved away many people started moving to Colorado and have changed the environment. It is much larger now and there <br>
        are many more people.</p>
    <p>I have traveled over half of this beautiful country and a few countries across the world and my traveling has not finshed yet. I<br>
        am soon to have a baby boy and hope that we will be able to continue my traveling together so that both of us can experince the <br>
        world that we live in together. I still haven't found the state that I want to call home, but I feel I am getting closer. It makes <br>
        me sad to leave my friends and move to new places, but it also allows me to gain new friends that I would never have me otherwise.<br></p>
    <p>Thank You for reading a little bit about me and where I come from! Best of wishes on your future endevors!</p>
